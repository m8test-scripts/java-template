# Public API script evidence matrix

Scope: methods consumed by Java scripts in this project’s Test Control suite. Each direct declaration is listed separately. An inherited declaration is counted once globally; if a parent or another child has a passing behavioral test, this project does not need a duplicate case for every child. This matrix contains only this project’s script-facing evidence.

Inventory: 23 public interfaces; 155 direct `@Keep` method declarations.

## Inherited declarations

Inherited methods are tracked by their declaring interface, not repeated for every child. A child fixture can supply the one required behavioral test.

## Limits and gaps

- Candidate detection matches method names in script source and does not prove receiver type or assertion; review the cited scenario before counting it as coverage.
- Only the 010 timeout/cancellation/loop/composed-wait slice has a method-level expected-log assertion and a recorded passing run in this matrix. Other fixture invocations remain candidates until their assertions and execution results are audited per method.
- Methods without a local fixture call remain individual gaps. Record an observation gap only after a suitable test boundary has been attempted and cannot observe the behavior reliably.
- The 010 case intentionally does not assert `CancellableContinuation.invokeOnCancellation` cleanup because cancellation during script shutdown raced with teardown.
